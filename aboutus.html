    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Balloon City has a rich history that spans over four decades. It all began in 1983 when Christine Yannetty Bernstein sold balloons at the St. Patrick's Day parade in South Boston. She soon realized the potential of the balloon industry and opened a small retail shop called "Balloon City USA," where she sold balloons, gifts, and novelties. The shop quickly gained popularity, and in 2002, the name was changed to Balloon City of Boston Inc.

For the past 25 years, Balloon City has been creating custom and unique balloon designs for every occasion. What started as a small retail shop has grown into a well-established business that offers a wide range of services, including custom imprinting, corporate and private event decorating, grand openings, political events, trade shows, and much more. Balloon City takes pride in providing exceptional customer service and delivering quality balloon decor that exceeds expectations.
